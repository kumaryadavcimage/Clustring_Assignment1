    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Efficiency: K-means is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with a relatively low computational cost compared to some other clustering algorithms.\n",
    "- Ease of Implementation: The algorithm is straightforward to implement and understand, making it accessible even to those with limited background in machine learning.\n",
    "- Scalability: K-means can scale well to large datasets and high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "- Versatility: It works well with data that is approximately spherical or globular in shape and where clusters have similar sizes.\n",
    "- Interpretability: The resulting clusters are easy to interpret, as each cluster is represented by its centroid, which can provide insights into the characteristics of the data within each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- Sensitivity to Initialization: K-means clustering is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids, which can lead to different clustering results for different initializations. Choosing the right number of clusters (K) and appropriate initial centroids can be challenging.\n",
    "- Assumption of Equal Variance: K-means assumes that clusters have equal variance, which may not hold true for all datasets. It performs poorly on elongated or irregularly shaped clusters, as it tends to create spherical clusters around centroids.\n",
    "- Susceptibility to Outliers: K-means is sensitive to outliers, as they can significantly affect the positions of centroids and consequently the clustering result. Outliers can distort cluster boundaries and lead to suboptimal clustering.\n",
    "- Fixed Number of Clusters: K-means requires the number of clusters (K) to be specified in advance, which may not always be known a priori and can be subjective.\n",
    "- Non-Convex Cluster Shapes: K-means struggles with identifying non-convex cluster shapes or clusters with varying densities, as it tends to produce spherical clusters around centroids."
